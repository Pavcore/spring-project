hello_stranger=Greetings, wanderer. I am not entirely surprised to see you. Many adventurers have come here since the troubles began.
diablo=I am sure you are aware of the tragedy that has befallen Tristram. They say that Diablo, the Lord of Terror, has come into the world once more.
dont=I do not know whether to believe it or not, but the Dark Wanderer passed through this way a few weeks ago. He headed east towards the mountains, taking the path guarded by the Monastery of the Wanderers.
maybe=It may not mean anything, but evil left its mark where he passed. Not long after his passage, the Monastery Gates closed, and strange creatures began to appear in the land.
lut_gholein=Until the camp is safer and the gates open again, I will remain here with my caravan. I hope to reach Lut Gholein before the shadow from Tristram engulfs us all. If you're alive and here, I can take you with me.
akara=I suggest you talk to Akara. It looks like she's in charge of this camp. Maybe she can tell you more.
after=After returning, you see the happy faces of the camp residents. Everyone thanks you for your help. Varriv suggests heading east.
quest_completed=You have completed the game! Congratulations!
